## Dicepoker

If someone wants to play a dicepoker he/she definitely needs to have dices. It happened to me ones. But instead of making trouble of looking for dices at the store, I sat in front of the computer and wrote my dicepoker application.

This is a good example, how effectively we can use nested lists and dictionaries.

**How to play?**

Run the dicepoker.py from your terminal or click the [![Binder link](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apy444/Dicepoker/master) which creates the environment, and open the dicepoke.ipynb. Run all.

You will see the results of five dices after the first throw. Continue playing, insert the letter of dices you want to throw again, two consecutive times. After that a new turn starts. Dices are displayed traditional way (dots on faces).
