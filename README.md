## Dicepoker

If someone wants to play a dicepoker he/she definitely needs to have dices. It happened to me ones. But instead of making trouble of looking for dices at the store, I sat in front of the computer and you can see the result here.

This is good example, how effectively can we use nested lists and dictionaries.

**How to play?**

Run the dicepoker.py from your terminal or use the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apy444/Dicepoker/master)

You will see the results of five dices after the first throw. Continue playing, you can throw again with selected dices, two consecutive times. After that a new turn starts. Dices are displayed traditional way (dots on faces).
